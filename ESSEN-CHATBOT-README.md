3. **Smart Routing**: Recognizes product inquiries and routes to appropriate information
4. **Showroom Focus**: Encourages visits for the complete ESSEN experience

## Testing the Bot

### Local Testing
```bash
# Test ESSEN-specific responses
node scripts/test-essen-bot.js

  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"object":"page","entry":[{"messaging":[{"sender":{"id":"123"},"message":{"text":"Looking for sofa for my BTO"}}]}]}'
```

### Sample Conversations
