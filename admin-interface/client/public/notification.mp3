# Notification Sound File

This is a placeholder for the notification.mp3 file.

To add a real notification sound:
1. Replace this file with an actual MP3 audio file
2. Name it notification.mp3
3. Place it in the admin-interface/client/public/ directory

The sound will be played when new messages arrive in the admin interface.
