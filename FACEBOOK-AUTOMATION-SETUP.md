2. **Your Bot** (2-5 seconds)
   - Contextual, intelligent responses
   
3. **Human Agent** (when requested)
   - Personal touch for complex queries

## 10. Message Tags & Types

Your bot handles:
- **Regular messages**: General inquiries
- **Quick replies**: Pre-set options
- **Postbacks**: Menu selections
- **Referrals**: From ads or m.me links

## 11. Creating m.me Links

Create targeted entry points:

```
https://m.me/YOUR_PAGE_ID?ref=sofa-promo
https://m.me/YOUR_PAGE_ID?ref=kitchen
https://m.me/YOUR_PAGE_ID?ref=consultation
```

Bot recognizes these and provides targeted welcomes!
